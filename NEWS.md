# prisonsreadyreckoner 1.0.0

First release for sharing with customers. Adds:

* Simplistic remand calculations accounting for the release of a proportion of
remand prisoners following expiry of custody time limits.


## Breaking changes

This version is not backwards compatible with version 0.0.0 because additional
parameters are required to generate the remand population impacts.



# prisonsreadyreckoner 0.0.0

Initial development version, used for demonstration on 15 June 2023. Includes
functions for use by the Shiny app (although the Shiny app,
prisons-ready-reckoner-app, v0.7.0).

Lacks many of the requirements of a package.
