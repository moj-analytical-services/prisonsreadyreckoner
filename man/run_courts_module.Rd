\arguments{
\item{cc_output}{A table of Crown Court disposal statistics provided by the
Courts Team.}

\item{cc_capacity}{A table of Crown Court sitting days and hours per sitting
day provided by the Courts Team.}

\item{cc_receipts_delta}{A table of deviations in Crown Court receipt volumes
under a single police charge scenario, lagged suitably to account for lag
to disposal.}

\item{mc_disposals_delta}{A table of deviations in magistrates' court
disposal volumes under a single police charge scenario.}

\item{cc_backlog_loaded}{A table of court backlogs for each receipt type
in the Crown Court.}

\item{mc_backlog_loaded}{A table of the court backlogs for SNM cases in the
magistrates' courts each month.}

\item{remand_coefficients}{A one-row table of the five coefficients from the
linear regression in the prisons model that are used to calculate remand from
court backlogs.}

\item{published_remand_pop}{The published remand population for use in error
checking.}

\item{sentencing_rates}{A table of linear regression co-efficients for
converting court disposal types to prison inflows by sentence band.}

\item{inflows_det}{The forecast prison inflows taken from the main prisons
model.}

\value{
A list including remand population impacts (\code{pop_remand_delta})
and forecast prison inflows (\code{inflows_det_adj}), including the
original volumes supplied by the Prisons Team
