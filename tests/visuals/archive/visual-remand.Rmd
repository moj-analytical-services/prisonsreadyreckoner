## Aim

To test how well our application of linear regression coefficients produces
remand volumes that match those used by the prisons team.

## Method

The Courts team produce a version of their crown output file (as used by the
Crown parts of prisonflowcast), which has a backlog adjusted to match HMCTS
outstanding caseload. The calibrated backlog is used by the Prisons team to
forecast demand by application of co-efficients from a linear regression.

We are using calibrated backlogs to forecast remand and test here that our
approach produces remand forecasts similar to those provided by the Prisons
team.

```{r include = FALSE}
#start_date <- as.Date("2022-11-01")    # First month of the forecast. Used for verifying inputs.

cc_output_file <- "s3://alpha-app-criminal-scenario-tool/developmentFolder/Dev_apr23_v1/model_outputs/sensitivity_baseline_230412_0819/crown-output-os_adj-apr23_s4.csv"   # 20230427 - Chun-yee Cheng - RE_ Latest Crown files_.msg
remand_file_target <- "s3://alpha-app-criminal-scenario-tool/developmentFolder/Dev_0901/model_outputs/_prison_outputs/_sensitivity/populations_apr23_s4_apr23_flat_3m_linear_6m_msim_EDS_change_os_adj_DandS_3m_current_6m_avg_longterm_230426_150555.xlsx"   # 20230503 - Charlotte Wallace - RE_ Gender split and remand ratio_.msg

```


## Results

First, can we produce the same remand forecast when using the Prisons Team's
regression co-efficients? In the following we have applied co-efficients
provided by the Prisons Team (See '20230503 - Charlotte Wallace - RE_ Gender
split and remand ratio_.msg') to backlog volumes provided by the Courts team
(see 20230427 - Chun-yee Cheng - RE_ Latest Crown files_.msg).

The match is virtually exact, possibly within rounding error. The exception is
the early period when the Prison Team they apply an additional 'calibration' to
ensure a smooth transition from remand population in the historical period.

Although this graph does not rely on package functions, it proves that our
interpretation of the co-efficients provided by the Prisons Team is correct.
